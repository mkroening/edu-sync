# Edu Sync

[![CI](https://github.com/mkroening/edu-sync/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mkroening/edu-sync/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Edu Sync is a command line application that synchronizes the contents of Moodle instances to your computer.

It accesses the Moodle instance via the Moodle mobile web services API, which is also used by the official Moodle mobile app.
To be able to use Edu Sync with a Moodle instance, the Moodle mobile web services must explicitly be enabled by the instance.

This application is written in Rust with a focus on speed.
Downloads are performed concurrently, which is beneficial when syncing many small files.

## Usage

You can view more detailed help information with:

```bash
$ edu-sync-cli help

        ```

    *   Using a token for the Moodle mobile web service.
